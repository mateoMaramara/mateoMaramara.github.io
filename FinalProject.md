## Overview

### The Problem
Many UH MƒÅnoa students struggle to find peer study groups that match their course schedules, academic goals, and communication preferences. While platforms like Discord exist, they are often unorganized, and not specific to UH courses or local campus life.

### The Solution
We propose StudyWhereUH, a web application where students can:
- Register and log in to create a profile with their enrolled courses and availability
- Be matched with other students based on shared classes, study preferences, and compatible schedules
- Create or join course specific study groups with built in tools (polls, calendar sync)
- View recommended campus study spots

Each user will have a customized dashboard based on their classes and preferences (this is our "special sauce").

## Team Members
This project idea was collaboratively written by:
- Mateo Maramara, Computer Science(BS)
- Michael Peterson, Computer Science(BS)
- Laurent Keith Villanueva, Computer Science(BS)

## Mockup Page Ideas
- Landing Page: Intro to app with login/register options
- Dashboard: Personalized with your courses, suggested study groups, and calendar
- Study Group Page: Group info, members, upcoming sessions, group chat
- Profile: Adjust your study preferences, schedule, and notifications

## Use Case Ideas
1. Lisa is a freshman taking ICS 111. She logs in and sees 3 potential study groups matching her schedule.
2. David prefers in-person meetups. He filters for groups that study at Hamilton Library.
3. Emily creates a new study group for Math 241 and invites others via class codes or links.

## Beyond the Basics
- Google Calendar integration
- Study spot suggestions based on user ratings/reviews
