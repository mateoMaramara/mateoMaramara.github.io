## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Bard have transformed how students learn and apply software engineering principles. These tools offer real-time assistance in understanding complex syntax, solving bugs, and generating example code. In ICS 314, we were encouraged to use these tools as part of the learning process, which helped me grow more confident and independent in my coding practice. I primarily used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot throughout the semester, balancing convenience with careful reflection to ensure I understood the material.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### 1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)

- For WODs without video solutions, I asked ChatGPT questions like:  
  *“How do I use arrow functions in TypeScript?”*  
  It helped explain concepts, which made me more confident going into the exercises.

- **E08**: I failed my first attempt. Afterward, I used ChatGPT to debug and learned that my code worked but I hadn’t clicked the correct log window. This helped me understand both the technical and UI side of the exercise.

---

### 2. In-Class Practice WODs

I often used AI during practice to understand problems before attempting the actual timed version. For example, I’d ask:  
*“What does this ESLint error mean: 'Expected indentation of 2 spaces but found 4'?”*  
This helped me clean up code and prepare confidently.

---

### 3. In-Class WODs

I used AI when stuck during timed exercises, but only after first trying to understand the problem myself. ChatGPT helped me quickly look up terminal commands or syntax I forgot. The stress of the timer made it important to save time where I could.

---

### 4. Essays

While AI tools like ChatGPT didn’t help much with idea generation, I used them to fact-check and rephrase explanations. For example, in Essay 1, I asked:  
*“How do you explain variable scope in JavaScript to a beginner?”*

---

### 5. Final Project

I surprisingly didn’t need AI much for the final project because the tasks were similar to earlier work. However, I did use Copilot to fix ESLint errors and used ChatGPT to remind me of the `npx prisma studio` command when viewing our database in Vercel.

---

### 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial

This was my most common AI use. If I didn’t understand a concept, I would ask ChatGPT:  
*“Explain functional programming in JavaScript like I’m 10 years old.”*  
The simplified explanations gave me a clearer foundation to build on.

---

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord

I didn’t post to Discord because I preferred asking AI tools first. Only when they failed or were unclear did I ask the instructor or classmates.

---

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart-Question

I never submitted a “smart question.” I felt more efficient using AI tools or searching documentation before reaching out to others.

---

### 9. Coding Example (e.g., `.pluck` in Underscore)

Outside of class, I asked ChatGPT:  
*“How do you use `.pluck` in Underscore.js?”*  
Even though it wasn’t directly used in ICS 314, it taught me how to extract data from arrays, which helped during backend work.

---

### 10. Explaining Code

This was a huge use case. I would paste code into ChatGPT and ask:  
*“Can you explain this function line by line?”*  
It often caught things I missed or misunderstood.

---

### 11. Writing Code

During in-class WODs, I sometimes pasted the prompt into ChatGPT and used the output as a reference—but only after I tried solving it myself. When the prompt was posted as an image, this method didn’t work, which was frustrating.

---

### 12. Documenting Code

I never used AI tools to write comments or documentation.

---

### 13. Quality Assurance

For debugging, I used prompts like:  
*“Fix the ESLint error: ‘no-unused-vars’ in this code block.”*  
It saved me time compared to digging through Stack Overflow.

---

### 14. Other Uses in ICS 314

I used ChatGPT to solve LeetCode problems in JavaScript instead of Python while studying for interviews. This reinforced concepts from ICS 314 like arrow functions, loops, and recursion.

---

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI tools helped me deepen my understanding of code by offering quick feedback, alternative explanations, and faster debugging. Instead of blindly copying answers, I made sure to ask follow-up questions like *“Why does this work?”* or *“What would happen if I changed this?”* Over time, I relied less on AI for solutions and more for clarity, which made me more confident in my abilities.

---

## IV. Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, I used ChatGPT during job interview prep to understand tricky coding questions. For example, I asked:  
*“Can you walk me through solving Two Sum in JavaScript?”*  
After attempting the problem myself, I compared my solution to ChatGPT’s and learned more efficient ways to approach it. Copilot also helped me during side projects by autofilling repetitive code like button handlers and state logic in React.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

One of the biggest challenges was not becoming too dependent on AI. In early WODs, I’d paste the entire prompt into ChatGPT hoping for a quick fix, but the answers often didn’t work as-is. Eventually, I treated AI more like a debugging partner or tutor. I think ICS 314 could offer more guidance on how to use AI effectively (e.g., what makes a good prompt, when to ask, and how to reflect on the response).

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Compared to traditional methods like lecture slides or textbook documentation, AI tools felt more interactive. Instead of searching through pages of material, I could ask a specific question and get a tailored answer. However, I still believe traditional resources are important for depth, especially when AI explanations are shallow or wrong. Together, they form a powerful learning ecosystem.

---

## VII. Future Considerations

As AI tools become more common, teaching students how to use them ethically and thoughtfully will be key. Future courses could include mini-lessons on prompt engineering, critical thinking with AI, and recognizing when AI is wrong. These skills will be essential in both school and industry.

---

## VIII. Conclusion

ICS 314 would have been a much harder class without AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. These tools didn’t just give me answers—they helped me think. I learned how to ask better questions, how to reflect on code, and how to debug smarter. Ultimately, AI supported my journey but never replaced the effort I had to put in myself. Like all good tools, it’s about how you use it.
