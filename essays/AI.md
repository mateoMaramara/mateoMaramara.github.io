## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools have transformed the world we live in today. Growing in popularity, the software can range from syntax checking to explaining abstract concepts like data structures and algorithms. Over the course of the last semester, I used these tools as scaffolding to learn new concepts, coding languages, and for assistance in understanding and debugging code. ICS314: Software Engineering, was one of the first classes that encouraged me to use AI tools for faster searching, debugging, and studying concepts. Especially helpful during timed coding exercises like WOD’s, I found these tools incredibly convenient with the caveat that I used them as a way to build my understanding of concepts, not as a shortcut for answers.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### 1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)

- **E03-E05**: These experiences required no technical work. Only making accounts and setting up for the semester.
- **E07a-E07b**: These were introductory bootcamps for Typescript and Javascript. I used ChatGPT here to explain concepts that were unclear. For example, I asked for reasons why I would use Typescript over Javascript.

- **E08**: Project Euler Problem 1: This WOD was fairly simple. What I found interesting was that I attempted the WOD the first time without any assistance, but failed to complete it in time. After my first attempt I watched the video solution and asked ChatGPT why my code was not working. What I found was that my code was correct the first time, however, I needed to click the tiny arrow in the top right corner to see the log. 
- **E09**: I did not use AI for this WOD. I simply felt I did not need it because I understood the demonstration video after my first attempt.
- **E10**: This was the first essay where I was allowed by an instructor to use AI tools. I found that ChatGPT was not helpful in the writing process. However, I wanted to make sure I was explaining concepts like variable declaration correctly. I asked ChatGPT questions about software engineering concepts to ensure the ideas in my essay were logically sound.
- **E11**: This essay was inherently difficult for me, because I had to find a real example on stack overflow that worked with my understanding of the material. While I came up with the ideas, I asked ChatGPT if they were correct. It responded with a corrected version. Which, in turn, led me to rewrite it in my words. I also used it as a thesaurus.
- **E12**: The Jamba Juice 1 WODs were difficult for me the first time. Because of this I did it exactly as recommended in the “Standard WOD Caveats” section. Opting not to use AI, referencing the demonstration video instead.
- **E13**: I used ChatGPT to explain the code given in the demonstration video. However, it was not very helpful in my immediate performance as I completed the WOD four times with a DNF.
- **E14**: I used both ChatGPT and Github Copilot for this WOD, but could not finish in time. This time I began plugging my errors into the AI tools asking what they mean and how to fix them.
- **E18**: Going into this WOD I had very little understanding of “functional programming”, so I used ChatGPT and Copilot to help me understand  how to use arrow functions.
- **E19**: I used ChatGPT for this WOD. Since it was only a few lines of code, I wanted to make sure I did it correctly. After reflecting on it, I think the act of asking questions to ChatGPT enacted a sort of “rubber ducky theory”. In turn, helping me think critically about the functions I used.
- **E20**: I used Github Copilot for this WOD, because I could not get a working solution without it. It was helpful in 
**E26-E27**: I remember using AI as a tool to explain the “Five Problems”. I did not understand them entirely from the article. Moreso, I used the Copilot extension to help me clear ESLint errors.
**E29**: I used ChatGPT to help explain HTML and CSS concepts covered in the FreeCodeCamp experience.
**E30-E32**: I was still getting the hang of HTML and CSS for this experience. If I had a question, I asked ChatGPT or Copilot so I would not have to ask a “smart question” on discord.
**E34-E36**: For the WODs involving Bootstrap 5, I wanted to make sure I understood them well. I was more concerned about the in-class WODs, so I used AI if I ran into a problem, and made sure to understand the solution.
**E41-E54**: For the rest of the WODs, I primarily used ChatGPT to help me with terminal commands I did not remember. Additionally, I would like to note how helpful they were with installing packages. Usually if my code had an error, it was due to an improper installation.

### 2. In-Class Practice WODs

I often used AI during practice to understand problems before attempting the actual timed version. For example, I’d ask:  
*“What does this ESLint error mean: 'Expected indentation of 2 spaces but found 4'?”*  
This helped me clean up code and prepare confidently.

---

### 3. In-Class WODs

I used AI when stuck during timed exercises, but only after first trying to understand the problem myself. ChatGPT helped me quickly look up terminal commands or syntax I forgot. The stress of the timer made it important to save time where I could.

---

### 4. Essays

While AI tools like ChatGPT didn’t help much with idea generation, I used them to fact-check and rephrase explanations. For example, in Essay 1, I asked:  
*“How do you explain variable scope in JavaScript to a beginner?”*

---

### 5. Final Project

I surprisingly didn’t need AI much for the final project because the tasks were similar to earlier work. However, I did use Copilot to fix ESLint errors and used ChatGPT to remind me of the `npx prisma studio` command when viewing our database in Vercel.

---

### 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial

This was my most common AI use. If I didn’t understand a concept, I would ask ChatGPT:  
*“Explain functional programming in JavaScript like I’m 10 years old.”*  
The simplified explanations gave me a clearer foundation to build on.

---

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord

I didn’t post to Discord because I preferred asking AI tools first. Only when they failed or were unclear did I ask the instructor or classmates.

---

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart-Question

I never submitted a “smart question.” I felt more efficient using AI tools or searching documentation before reaching out to others.

---

### 9. Coding Example (e.g., `.pluck` in Underscore)

Outside of class, I asked ChatGPT:  
*“How do you use `.pluck` in Underscore.js?”*  
Even though it wasn’t directly used in ICS 314, it taught me how to extract data from arrays, which helped during backend work.

---

### 10. Explaining Code

This was a huge use case. I would paste code into ChatGPT and ask:  
*“Can you explain this function line by line?”*  
It often caught things I missed or misunderstood.

---

### 11. Writing Code

During in-class WODs, I sometimes pasted the prompt into ChatGPT and used the output as a reference—but only after I tried solving it myself. When the prompt was posted as an image, this method didn’t work, which was frustrating.

---

### 12. Documenting Code

I never used AI tools to write comments or documentation.

---

### 13. Quality Assurance

For debugging, I used prompts like:  
*“Fix the ESLint error: ‘no-unused-vars’ in this code block.”*  
It saved me time compared to digging through Stack Overflow.

---

### 14. Other Uses in ICS 314

I used ChatGPT to solve LeetCode problems in JavaScript instead of Python while studying for interviews. This reinforced concepts from ICS 314 like arrow functions, loops, and recursion.

---

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI tools helped me deepen my understanding of code by offering quick feedback, alternative explanations, and faster debugging. Instead of blindly copying answers, I made sure to ask follow-up questions like *“Why does this work?”* or *“What would happen if I changed this?”* Over time, I relied less on AI for solutions and more for clarity, which made me more confident in my abilities.

---

## IV. Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, I used ChatGPT during job interview prep to understand tricky coding questions. For example, I asked:  
*“Can you walk me through solving Two Sum in JavaScript?”*  
After attempting the problem myself, I compared my solution to ChatGPT’s and learned more efficient ways to approach it. Copilot also helped me during side projects by autofilling repetitive code like button handlers and state logic in React.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

One of the biggest challenges was not becoming too dependent on AI. In early WODs, I’d paste the entire prompt into ChatGPT hoping for a quick fix, but the answers often didn’t work as-is. Eventually, I treated AI more like a debugging partner or tutor. I think ICS 314 could offer more guidance on how to use AI effectively (e.g., what makes a good prompt, when to ask, and how to reflect on the response).

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Compared to traditional methods like lecture slides or textbook documentation, AI tools felt more interactive. Instead of searching through pages of material, I could ask a specific question and get a tailored answer. However, I still believe traditional resources are important for depth, especially when AI explanations are shallow or wrong. Together, they form a powerful learning ecosystem.

---

## VII. Future Considerations

As AI tools become more common, teaching students how to use them ethically and thoughtfully will be key. Future courses could include mini-lessons on prompt engineering, critical thinking with AI, and recognizing when AI is wrong. These skills will be essential in both school and industry.

---

## VIII. Conclusion

ICS 314 would have been a much harder class without AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. These tools didn’t just give me answers—they helped me think. I learned how to ask better questions, how to reflect on code, and how to debug smarter. Ultimately, AI supported my journey but never replaced the effort I had to put in myself. Like all good tools, it’s about how you use it.
