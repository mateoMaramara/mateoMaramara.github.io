## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence(AI) tools have transformed the world we live in today. Growing in popularity, the software can range from syntax checking to explaining abstract concepts like data structures and algorithms. Over the course of the last semester, I used these tools as scaffolding to learn new concepts, coding languages, and for assistance in understanding and debugging code. ICS314: Software Engineering, was one of the first classes that encouraged me to use AI tools for faster searching, debugging, and studying concepts. Especially helpful during timed coding exercises like WOD’s, I found these tools incredibly convenient with the caveat that I used them as a way to build my understanding of concepts, not as a shortcut for answers.


## Personal Experience with AI
Reflect on your personal experiences with AI technologies within ICS 314. Provide specific examples of how you have used AI or explanations as to why you have not used AI (e.g. “I tried it for xxx and found it did not give useful results” or “I thought it important for me to find an answer on my own.”) for each of the following course elements:
Experience WODs e.g. E18:
For the “Experience WODs” where there were no video solutions, I used AI tools to answer my questions and it helped a lot. Additionally, for experiences that had video solutions that I did not entirely understand, I used AI tools. 
E03-E05: These experiences required no technical work. Only making accounts and setting up for the semester.
E07a -E07b: These were introductory bootcamps for Typescript and Javascript. I used ChatGPT here to explain concepts that were unclear. For example, I asked for reasons why I would use Typescript over Javascript.
E08: Project Euler Problem 1: This WOD was fairly simple. What I found interesting was that I attempted the WOD the first time without any assistance, but failed to complete it in time. After my first attempt I watched the video solution and asked ChatGPT why my code was not working. What I found was that my code was correct the first time, however, I needed to click the tiny arrow in the top right corner to see the log. 
E09: I did not use AI for this WOD. I simply felt I did not need it because I understood the demonstration video after my first attempt.
E10: This was the first essay where I was allowed by an instructor to use AI tools. I found that ChatGPT was not helpful in the writing process. However, I wanted to make sure I was explaining concepts like variable declaration correctly. I asked ChatGPT questions about software engineering concepts to ensure the ideas in my essay were logically sound.
E11: This essay was inherently difficult for me, because I had to find a real example on stack overflow that worked with my understanding of the material. While I came up with the ideas, I asked ChatGPT if they were correct. It responded with a corrected version. Which, in turn, led me to rewrite it in my words. I also used it as a thesaurus. 
E12: The Jamba Juice 1 WODs were difficult for me the first time. Because of this I did it exactly as recommended in the “Standard WOD Caveats” section. Opting not to use AI, referencing the demonstration video instead.
E13: I used ChatGPT to explain the code given in the demonstration video. However, it was not very helpful in my immediate performance as I completed the WOD four times with a DNF.
E14: I used both ChatGPT and Github Copilot for this WOD, but could not finish in time. This time I began plugging my errors into the AI tools asking what they mean and how to fix them.
E18: Going into this WOD I had very little understanding of “functional programming”, so I used ChatGPT and Copilot to help me understand  how to use arrow functions.
E19: I used ChatGPT for this WOD. Since it was only a few lines of code, I wanted to make sure I did it correctly. After reflecting on it, I think the act of asking questions to ChatGPT enacted a sort of “rubber ducky theory”. In turn, helping me think critically about the functions I used.
E20: I used Github Copilot for this WOD, because I could not get a working solution without it. It was helpful in 
E26 - E27: I remember using AI as a tool to explain the “Five Problems”. I did not understand them entirely from the article. Moreso, I used the Copilot extension to help me clear ESLint errors.
E29: I used ChatGPT to help explain HTML and CSS concepts covered in the FreeCodeCamp experience.
E30-E32: I was still getting the hang of HTML and CSS for this experience. If I had a question, I asked ChatGPT or Copilot so I would not have to ask a “smart question” on discord.
E34-E36: For the WODs involving Bootstrap 5, I wanted to make sure I understood them well. I was more concerned about the in-class WODs, so I used AI if I ran into a problem, and made sure to understand the solution.
E41-E54: For the rest of the WODs, I primarily used ChatGPT to help me with terminal commands I did not remember. Additionally, I would like to note how helpful they were with installing packages. Usually if my code had an error, it was due to an improper installation. 
In-class Practice WODs
I almost always used AI for the practice WODs. But usually to ask questions so I could try and do it without AI tools. I was more concerned about the grade I would receive for the in-class WODS. That is why I tried my best to understand what was going on for the practice WODs. I listed all of the unique experiences above. However, after the E38 WOD I used the same strategies so they would be redundant to repeat. 
In-class WODs
The In-Class WODs were stressful. Since they were timed, and the grade was pass or fail, I used AI tools in any way that would help me pass. However, my first approach was always to read the prompt and try to understand the question. This actually instilled the belief in me that the hardest thing about timed coding exercises is understanding the question. If I understood the prompt, I really only needed to reference AI tools for terminal commands and data that would have otherwise taken up time.
Essays
Since AI tools were allowed, I tried to use them for essays. However, it was not much help, since AI’s ideas were so different from mine. For example, the essay on design patterns was difficult to do on my own because we were given very little information about design patterns and what they were. That is why I used AI tools to teach me, and I made my own metaphors and examples to the best of my ability.
Final project
Ironically, for the final project I often did not need AI tools since many of the obstacles I faced were similar to ones I had done before. However, I did find the Github Copilot extension helpful for correcting formatting issues and ESLint errors. Additionally, I found them helpful in explaining how to access the vercel database. One example is that I could not remember the “npx prisma studio” command when trying to view my team's data. 
Learning a concept / tutorial
This is primarily how I used AI tools. Since code from AI software often does not work without context. If I could not figure out how to do something, I would ask questions to AI tools until I got a working answer.
Answering a question in class or in Discord
I never did this. Since I was allowed to use AI tools, it did not make sense to post a question to discord. Nonetheless, if I could not get an answer from all of my AI tools or resources, I would ask our professor or classmates if they had any ideas for a potential way forward in troubleshooting.
Asking or answering a smart-question
I never did this. Similar to my answer for question 7, I only asked questions if I could not get an answer from AI tools or by googling it.
Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
I used this outside of class when studying for interviews. However, it ended up applying to many of the things I needed to use for class. For example, while doing in class WODs, I asked “can you explain how to use arrow functions in js and ts” because it was simply a different way to use functions. However, it ended up being helpful on the in-class WODs so I decided to share.
Explaining code
This was the majority of how I used AI tools. I would often paste the file or function into the tool I was using, followed by “can you explain this” and the intuitive nature of the AI tools would begin debugging.
Writing code
I primarily used this tool for in class timed WODs. I pasted the prompt into all of the AI tools and used the functions that I understood for my code. However I stopped doing this tragically during an in-class WOD where the instructions were posted as a photo. 
Documenting code
I never used it for this.
Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
This was primarily how I debugged my code if I ran into errors. I found it much faster than using stackoverflow.
Other uses in ICS 314 not listed:
I used ChatGPT to help explain leetcode problems. Since I was taking ICS314 and learning javascript while studying for interviews, I decided to do my leetcode problems in javascript instead of python. This definitely helped me with the WODs.
## Impact on Learning and Understanding
Overall, I think the use of AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot helped me learn software engineering concepts that may have otherwise come from trial and error. If I referred to documentation that did not directly answer my question, I had AI tools to fall back on. Additionally, I never knew when ChatGPT or Copilot would go down. So I made sure to always ask why something worked or did not work. I think this approach made me a more efficient and confident software engineer.

## Practical Applications
Outside of ICS 314, I used ChatGPT for job interview prep. I found it especially useful in explaining leetcode problems. However, there is no way around practice. Even with the use of ChatGPT and Copilot, I found it necessary to close other browsers and work through problems without any assistance. It was more helpful after my attempt, when I would try to figure out where my knowledge gaps were. Additionally, following up with the problems without assistance was helpful for cementing my understanding of the concepts.

## Challenges and Opportunities
One of the biggest challenges I had was not becoming dependent on AI. During early WODs, if I was running out of time I would copy the entire prompt and code, then paste it into the AI tool. I soon realized the approach was a waste of time and effort. Following this understanding, I tried to approach AI use similar to using an advanced google search. While it was a larger learning curve, I retained much more information. Also, some potential opportunities for further integration of AI in software engineering education could be intro level classes on how to use AI tools to self-teach. Since the majority of software engineering is self taught, there is a large potential for students to depend on these tools, without truly learning anything.

## Comparative Analysis
Traditional teaching methods like powerpoint lectures or reading documentation have worked for me because I had no other options. However, I think speed, accessibility, and 24 hour assistance, are all qualities that make AI enhanced approaches superior. Especially since coding is something that has to be practiced, having a tool that does not have restricted office hours, and does not ever run out of patience can be incredibly helpful if it is used correctly.

## Future Considerations
While AI tools are growing in popularity and efficiency, their role in education and software engineering will proliferate as well. However, as these tools change over time, reconsidering their use in education will be imperative. AI tools can be used for so many diverse purposes, so it is important to use them as tools, not crutches. Teaching ethics, critical thinking, and how to use these tools will be more crucial in the next coming years than ever before.

## Conclusion
ICS314 would have been a very different experience without the permitted use of tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. These tools are too versatile to be ignored. I asked more questions to ChatGPT this semester than any of my TA’s or instructors in ICS314. In my opinion, that is a good thing because it saves both of us time and effort. Regardless of where the answer comes from, it has always been up to me to think critically about that answer's place in my code, and in my education. Like almost any subject, software engineering is something that must be taught to oneself. Regardless of where you get an idea, practice and implementation is always going to be up to the individual.
