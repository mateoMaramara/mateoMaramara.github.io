Design patterns can help software engineers write scalable code that is easy to maintain, understand, and implement. But, what are design patterns really? Well, as a certified “gym rat”, I like to look at them the same way I see my training regimen; systematic, but flexible. I want my design patterns to work just like my workouts; targeting specific goals, efficient, and always built for growth.

As it is typical for most gym goers, I have a plan of execution before entering my IDE, or, “Iron Development Environment” as I like to call it. Because going to the gym with no plan is a recipe for disaster and can lead to poor results or injury. Similarly, design patterns follow tested and reliable templates that remain flexible for maximum efficiency. Flexibility is especially important. Since, I may not want to wait for the next available bench press during the 6pm rush hour, I might use a machine that works the same muscle group. In the case of my final group project for software engineering I, I might not use the exact same implementation, but I will apply the same principles to get the same results. In short, design patterns are the same. They are just structured ways to solve routine problems.

With ManoaConnect, we didn’t start from scratch because we had our instructors template. But on the other hand, my group still had a lot to figure out. The most difficult, was deciding as a group how we wanted to organize our code, and build features. In my opinion, this was where design patterns were most effective. Before implementing any code, we looked at the problems we wanted to solve, and used design patterns to guide us. In a way, it is just like having a workout plan, we had an idea of what we wanted to do, and clear objectives, then we stayed flexible as things changed.

Ultimately, design patterns are not a set of rules mandatory for design success, they just make the process more efficient. In my opinion, they make prevalent tasks easier to accomplish. Just like workout routines, having a plan, and using tested methods makes it easier to be consistent and get the ideal results. With ManoaConnect, design patterns helped us structure our work. More importantly, because of design patterns we were able to stay organized, write better code, and focus on building the features we wanted. While there are endless design features to implement,
