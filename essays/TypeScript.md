Although it is only my second week working with TypeScript I have noticed some significant differences between other programming languages I have worked with. I am familiar with the languages Java, Python, C and C++ and despite my trouble with TypeScript I have not experienced any difficulties learning any of them. However, after I get over the learning curve, I do think it will be an incredibly useful programming language. My favorite thing about TypeScript is that it catches errors, unlike JavaScript. It is much more comforting being able to catch an error while working fast through a timed exercise. For example, if I enter the wrong data type in my code TypeScript will let me know. Conversely, TypeScript has its downsides. While I am new to the language, small syntax changes from JavaScript like specifying the type of variable I am declaring will take some getting used to. However, once I am comfortable with the small syntax changes I am confident that the language will be much easier to work with.

Additionally, athletic software engineering is difficult, but I think that difficulty is why it is so important to practice. The practice WODs are also an incredible tool that puts enough pressure on myself as a programmer to work faster. I think being able to write programs quickly is an important aspect of software engineering, and I think “getting faster” at programming is a strong base for being a more well rounded programmer. Another aspect of athletic software engineering that I enjoy is that it is a “hands on” exercise. While other methods of pedagogy may be more grounded in thought, I appreciate that the WODs are more grounded in doing. I am excited for the next WODs and I think I will learn alot from them.

Overall, I am excited for this opportunity to expand my knowledge of programming in total. Ultimately, the goal is to complete the WODs in a reasonable time. But more importantly, I think the process of failing WODs, and learning from my mistakes is a critical aspect of learning software development as a whole. With practice, consistency, and the right tools, I am confident that TypeScript will be another challenge that contributes to my growth as a software engineer.
