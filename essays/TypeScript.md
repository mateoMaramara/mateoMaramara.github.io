Although it is only the second week working with TypeScript I have noticed some significant differences between other programming languages I have worked with. I am familiar with the languages Java, Python, C and C++ and despite my trouble with TypeScript I have not had a hard time learning any of them. Despite the steep learning curve with TypeScript, I do think it will be an incredibly useful programming language. My favorite thing about TypeScript is that it catches errors, unlike JavaScript. It is much more comforting being able to catch an error while working fast through a timed exercise. For example, if I enter the wrong data type in my code TypeScript will let me know.


Additionally, athletic software engineering is difficult, but I think that difficulty is why it is so important to practice. The practice WODs are also an incredible tool that puts enough pressure on myself as a programmer to work faster. I think being able to write programs quickly is an important aspect of software engineering, and I think “getting faster” at programming is a strong base for being a more well rounded programmer. Another aspect of athletic software engineering that I enjoy is that it is a “hands on” exercise. While other methods of pedagogy may be more grounded in thought, I appreciate that the WODs are more grounded in doing. I am excited for the next WODs and I think I will learn alot from them.
