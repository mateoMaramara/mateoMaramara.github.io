## How did you make your effort estimates?

For my effort estimates, I used my best guess based off of similar tasks like the digits assignments and my inherent knowledge as to whether I already had a solution in mind. For example, issue 19 of milestone 2, “Have Create clubs write to database 19” was daunting because my only experience writing to the database was during E59, which was my first time; so I figured I could do it at least the same speed the second time.

## Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?

Yes I think making the estimates in advance were beneficial because it made me think about time management and which features were going to need priority. For example, on milestone 3, “Fix Signup”, issue 81, I knew it didn’t work, but I did not know why. The estimate was 30 minutes but it actually took 45 minutes of trial and error. Having the approximation of 30 minutes, gave me a goal to try and meet. Although I was 15 minutes over, I think having a deadline incentivized me to move efficiently.

## Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not? Was there any downside to estimating and tracking your effort? If so what?

Most of my estimates were greater than the time it actually took to complete the tasks. I don’t think there was a large benefit to tracking my effort since the issues were resolved, and no issue was exactly the same because each bug or problem was looked at on a case by case basis.

## How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?

For my effort tracking I looked at the clock before and after finishing. I do recognize the accuracy of my tracking could have been thrown off because of potential unaccounted for “non-coding effort”. However, that was difficult because typically I don’t do coding and non-coding effort separately. It has always made more sense to find solutions to problems as they come up. But I tried to have a plan of action before starting a task so I could try and work through it entirely.

## How much overhead was there in tracking your effort? Did it take up a noticable amount of time or inhibit you working on the project?

I do think it took up more time than necessary. However, I think the greatest noticeable amount of time that inhibited me from working on the project was thinking about how long it would take to do something. Most of the time I was unsure about the estimation when I had no idea how to solve the problem. However, for issues I knew how to solve it did not take very long because I was confident in my ability to complete it.
