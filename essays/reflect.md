# ICS 314: Software Engineering Reflection

This class covered a lot more than just how to make websites. While the projects we worked on were mostly web-based, the structure behind how we wrote, managed, and collaborated on code came from real software engineering practices. I learned that good code isn’t just about what the program does—it's about how well it’s built, maintained, and documented over time. In this reflection, I’ll go over five concepts I learned in this course that go beyond just building web applications: Agile Project Management, Issue Driven Project Management, Configuration Management, Design Patterns, Functional Programming, and Ethics in Software Engineering.

## Agile Project Management

Agile Project Management is an iterative and flexible approach to planning and building software. Instead of trying to complete everything all at once like in the traditional "waterfall" method, Agile encourages constant progress and reevaluation. Work is broken into smaller units called iterations or sprints. The team focuses on completing a few features at a time, reviews what’s been done, and then adapts based on feedback.

Agile isn’t just a coding workflow—it’s a mindset. It promotes communication, flexibility, and frequent delivery of working software. I’ve already started thinking about how this style could apply to personal projects, group work, and even non-technical planning. It's all about taking things one meaningful step at a time.

## Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM)

A specific version of Agile we used in ICS 314 was **Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM)**. Instead of managing work through abstract lists or emails, we used GitHub issues to track everything. Each issue represented a single unit of work—something that could be completed in a few hours. Issues were labeled, assigned to specific people, and linked to project milestones.

What made IDPM work so well was its structure. Everyone knew what they were responsible for, and it was easy to measure progress. This system helped us avoid vague goals or overlapping responsibilities. It also made it easier to collaborate asynchronously because all the task information was in one place. Even outside of software development, I could see IDPM being used for things like organizing an event, managing a content calendar, or planning research tasks—anything where small tasks build into a larger goal.

## Configuration Management

Before this class, I didn’t know how important Git was. I thought of it as just a backup system. But in this course, I learned that Configuration Management is all about tracking and managing changes to code so that everything stays consistent and you don’t lose work. We used GitHub for version control, which let us branch off our own features, submit pull requests, and merge everything together safely.

This was super helpful during group work. We could all work on different parts of the code at the same time without stepping on each other's toes. Now I get why version control is so essential for team-based development. Outside of class, I can see this being important for any kind of shared document or system—anything where multiple people are making changes.

## Design Patterns

Design Patterns are basically templates or common solutions for recurring problems in code. Instead of inventing a new solution every time, you can follow a proven strategy that’s been used before. One example is the Observer Pattern, which we sort of used in React by having components update when state changed.

Even though we didn’t memorize every design pattern, I started noticing when and why people use them. Understanding these patterns makes it easier to work on big projects and read someone else’s code. They also help make your own code easier to update or reuse. Whether I’m working in JavaScript or a completely different language later on, the logic behind these patterns still applies.

## Functional Programming

Functional Programming was something I didn’t know much about until this class. We used functions a lot in JavaScript, but this course showed me how powerful it is to think about data and actions in terms of pure functions. A pure function doesn’t change anything outside of itself—it just takes input and returns output.

Using this approach helped me write cleaner, more predictable code. I especially saw this in the utility functions we wrote during WODs and in the way we handled state in components. It made debugging easier, too, because I didn’t have to worry about weird side effects. I think functional programming is one of those concepts that I’ll keep seeing again and again no matter what language I use.

## Ethics in Software Engineering

One of the most unexpected topics we covered was ethics. I always thought programming was just about building things, but this course made me realize that what we build and how we build it actually matters. For example, we talked about how certain features could be misused—like tracking users without their knowledge, or writing code that favors one group over another.

It made me think more critically about my responsibility as a developer. Even something as small as how accessible a website is can make a difference. I realized that writing ethical code isn’t a bonus—it’s part of doing the job right. I appreciated that this class included this topic because it reminded me that programming affects real people.

## Final Thoughts

ICS 314 didn’t just teach me how to code a web app—it taught me how to think like a software engineer. Concepts like Agile, version control, design patterns, and ethics aren’t limited to web development; they’re part of almost every coding job out there. The course gave me a good balance of hands-on practice and real-world structure. I still have a lot to learn, but now I feel like I have a stronger foundation and a better idea of how to approach future projects—whether they involve websites or not.
