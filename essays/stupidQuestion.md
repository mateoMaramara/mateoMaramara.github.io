It is no secret that software engineering requires consistent research. As technology evolves engineers must find a way to adapt. In “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”, Eric Raymond makes a point that the way we ask a question often determines the kind of answer we get. The essay discusses the importance of individual research, clear communication, and gives insight on the components of a question that may get a positive and useful response, and alternatively, things that comprise a “Not Smart” question. This technical essay will cover some of the different ways people ask questions by analyzing two Stack Overflow questions I found.

## What is a “Not-So-Smart” Question?
The question below stood out to me as a good example of one that is “Not-Smart”. These types of questions are typically unclear, and make it difficult for someone to help you. In this case it seemed like it left me with more questions than answers.

In ["The beginners' error in TypeScript"
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47630677/the-beginners-error-in-typescript) the user was asking why their TypeScript class was not working, but did so in a way that makes it difficult to help. The first problem was that they were unclear on what they needed help with. They could have fixed this by providing a brief summary of what the issue actually was. Instead, they simply pasted their code with the error and followed it with “How can I run my first typescript?”. Another issue with this question is that he did not provide any troubleshooting steps. Not letting others know clearly what the issue was, not providing any troubleshooting steps taken, and not doing the research to find a solution before asking, they set themselves up for failure. One of the responses actually pointed out that the issue was due to the variable and class name being exactly the same. With some research debugging, the user may have been able to solve the problem before they had asked for help.

## What is a Smart Question?
A smart question, conversely, makes it easy for other users to help you. It is clear, structured, and the user asking has done their research. Good questions come from individual research, effort to solve it, and clear communication providing relevant information. The question below is a good example.

In ["How to use typeScript with native ES6 Promises"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27573365/how-to-use-typescript-with-native-es6-promises) the question here is short and clear. The user is new to TypeScript but does not know how to work with ES6 promises. They give their environment details, share their error message, and ask clearly how they can fix it. There were multiple solutions, different approaches and most importantly, many users were able to help. Since the user put in the work to do some research, they put others in a position where it was easy to help.

## Ask.
In a rapidly changing and proliferating field like software engineering, asking questions will always be part of the job. But the key concept I got from Eric Raymond's essay was that a well thought out, structured question is one that can spark both thoughtful and engaging dialogue. While a vague question with little explanation may result in no answers at all.

While we could all improve on how we phrase and shape our technical questions, doing research, being clear and concise, and providing all of the necessary information is the best place to start. Because overall, asking questions is not about getting solutions, it is about solving problems.
