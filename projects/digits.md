**Digits** is a contacts and notes management application I built as part of the ICS 314 course at the University of HawaiÊ»i. Users can log in securely, add new contacts with information such as name, address, image, and description, and attach notes to each contact to track interactions or personal reminders.

Each user can only see and manage their own contacts and notes, while administrators can view the entire database. The app uses modern technologies including **Next.js**, **Prisma ORM**, **PostgreSQL**, and **TypeScript** to ensure scalable, maintainable, and performant development.
